# Conway's Game of Life Visual and Audio Experience

This application is a visual and audio experience based on Conway's Game of Life.

The application visually represents the cells of the Game of Life with images, creating a more graphical and appealing version of the game. The application also responds to audio input, specifically the decibel level of the audio, to influence the game dynamics.

## Features

- Conway's Game of Life simulation with graphical cells represented by images
- Response to audio input, adjusting the pace of the game and the live cell percentage based on the audio level
- Different sequence modes including vertical and horizontal movement, add a dynamic aspect to the game visualization

Note! This was programmed with M1 processing power in mind and 16gb ram, but it will work better on PCs with 16gb ram or more, M1 processor or higher, intel i7 12th generation or higher, and the more graphic processing power the better
